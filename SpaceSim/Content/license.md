Hey Guys, 

This is the only human character I have made for my game thus far, I'll be adding more as I go.  I'm going to try to get a base layer down so people can create their own character's in the same dimensions easier.  If anyone has advice on the format or how to do the base correctly please don't hesitate to give me advice.  

**Note: Sorry, I make my art in pixelmator, it isn't allowing me to upload my file?  I'll just upload the png file and hopefully that's ok.
